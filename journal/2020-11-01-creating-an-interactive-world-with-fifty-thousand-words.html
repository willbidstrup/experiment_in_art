  <div class="journal-entry">
    <p style="font-family: monospace; color: grey; font-size: 14px;">Sunday, November 1st, 2020 </p> <!-- TODO make this a class -->
    <p>I have decided to participate in <a style="color: black;" href="https://nanowrimo.org/">National Novel Writing Month</a> which is an
       event which creates motivation and structure for writers to complete a first draft of a new novel. <br>
       I will also be checking in with other people who are on the journey.
       I like the idea of a group helping each other do this kind of thing, and connecting with people crazy enough to attempt it</p>
       <br>
    <h4><strong>What I will write about</strong></h4>
    <p>I am going to create an interactive world, by which I mean narrative content
      that is suitable for a reader to explore and choose from various branching paths,
      which in time reveals places, people and choices. Through interaction a story is uncovered.
      <br><br>
      The words I write in November will all eventually live in a game of sorts,
      but I am unclear on exactly how they will be published in the end; perhaps
      a very straight interactive novel on a website; or maybe as content to supplement
      a traditional tabletop roleplaying game; or most ambitiously,
      as content that is weaved into computer roleplaying game.
      <br><br>
      As of this moment I have no fixed ideas on the style or genre of the writing.
      The world will be revealed through the writing. The driving aim is that the
      story will not be static and the reader will be presented with interesting choices.
      <br><br>
      I will be writing scenes which end in options. This format will demand making
      each scene somewhat self-contained, there is (probably) less room for long
      set pieces than in novel. Each scene must invite some sort of decision to be made.
      <br>
    </p>
      <h4><strong>Why I am coosing this topic</strong></h4>
      <p>I want to test my skills and interest in writing for games.
        I suspect it will be something I enjoy and can do, as there is a kind of
         organisational and technical aspect to the genre that feels close to
          programming and decision science. Plus I love games.
          <br> <br>
        However, in November I am certainly not going to do anything except write.
        I will not touch the tools which will bring the interactive experience to life -
        this month is all about words only.
        <br>
      </p>
      <h4><strong>Inspiration</strong></h4>
      <p>I have never attempted anything like this before. I will be referring to and channeling inspiration from;
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ultima IV</li>
        <li>Hot Springs Island</li>
        <li>Disco Elysium</li>
        <li>Duel Master</li>
        <li>Six Ages</li>
        <li>Forbidden Lands</li>
        <li>80 Days</li>
      </ul>
      <h4><strong>Technical notes</strong></h4>
      <ul>
        <li>I will write for two hours every working day</li>
        <li>In each two hour session I will write eight scenes which total 2,500 words</li>
        <li>2,500 words per session * 20 sessions = 50,000 words</li>
        <li>20 sessions * 8 scenes = 160 scenes </li>
        <li>I will use the <a style="color: black;" href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/28/10853534/flowstate-writing-app-mac-ios-delete-everything">Flowstate App</a> for cranking the words out</li>
      </ul>
      <h4><strong>Week one update</strong>
      <p style="font-family: monospace; color: grey; font-size: 14px;">Saturday, November 7th, 2020 </p>
      <p> I have been writing approximately 2500 words per day for seven days straight. This has been an illuminating experience.
        <br> <br>
        I have arrived at a strong concept for the game, and subsequently an outline.
        Importantly, after riffing around with actual words, the outline feels much more substantial than if I had started with lists, timelines and boxes.
        <br> <br>
        I have made these decions about the project;
        <ul>
          <li>It will be a game, codename is 'The Silver Tower'</li>
          <li>It will be a very simple game, with 'scoring' via the uncovering of Secrets</li>
          <li>There will be no chance, everything is directed by decision making based on information gleaned through play</li>
          <li>The interactive world now has a name, it is ‘The village of Eastcliffe and surrounding areas reachable by overland travel in 2 days”</li>
          <li>The level of technology is pre-industrial renaissance, level of magic is 'Conan and druids'</li>
          <li>Culture is pseudo-Scottish, lakes are lochs but you can understand everybody</li>
          <li>The player will be able to create their own character (no pre-built protagonists)</li>
          <li>The overarching story is simple but there will be a large number of possible endings</li>
          <li>There will be three companions to choose from who will strongly influence the game</li>
        </ul>
