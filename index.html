    <h3>Welcome</h3>
    <p>By default I am William Bidstrup but I muse and make under many guises. <br>
      This is my digital home, where I celebrate victory and learn from defeat as I quest along the path of life. <br>
    It is where I store my work because thoughts must be shared to be real.</p>
