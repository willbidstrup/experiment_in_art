<h2> Principles</h2>
<h4> Monday, 20<sup>th</sup> September 2020</h4>

<p> This website is a record of explorations, successes and failures in my quest to make and share Art. <br>
All pages are hand-coded with no third-party templates or shortcuts. <br>
Content is shared once a week.<br>
The inner soul of the Experimental Artist is revealed to those who pass by, offering stern warnings or comforting inspiration.
