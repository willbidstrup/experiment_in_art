      <description>“Words are to writers as clay is to sculptors.”
― (Old Jungle Saying)
 Each morning I wrestle with my computer for exactly ten minutes and crank out some sentences. I have learned that I can deliver around 500 words in this timeframe. This is seemingly the maximum output my brain and two-finger clawhammer typing technique can muster. For now.
I have been writing for many years in a sporadic fashion including publishing a few short stories and more than a few songs.</description>

      <description>I am at war with the demons that lurk inside of me.
They are crafty and patient and relentless. They change their tactics and exploit any weakness to achieve their objectives.
Sometimes I give them names to make it easier to disassociate and gather my strength against them. Sometimes I lament their existence and turn their qualities into aspects of my art. Pain, frustration, regret, fear; these can all be used to counterpoint and accentuate joy, forgiveness and peace.</description>
