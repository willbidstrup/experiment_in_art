I want to be a more considered and intentional reader, so I am going to record each book that I read. That is what a considered and intentional reader would do, right?  I do not include study textbooks in this list.  

```{r, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)

```


```{r, include = FALSE}
# Create df

reading_list <- data.frame(matrix(vector(mode = 'character',length = 6), nrow = 0, ncol = 7), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

names(reading_list) <- c("Category", "Title", "Author", "Date_start", "Date_end", "Skulls", "Notes")

glimpse(reading_list)
```


# Summary

```{r, include = FALSE}
book_1 <- c("Non Fiction", "The Joy Of Less", "Francine Jay", "2019-12-31", "TBC", "0", "TBC")
book_1_df <- data.frame(t(book_1), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
names(book_1_df) <- names(reading_list)
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
book_2 <- c("Fiction", "Annihilation", "Jeff VanDermeer", "2019-12-31", "TBC", "0", "TBC")
book_2_df <- data.frame(t(book_2), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
names(book_2_df) <- names(reading_list)
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
reading_list <- reading_list %>%
  bind_rows(book_1_df) %>%
  bind_rows(book_2_df)
```

```{r,echo = FALSE}
kable(reading_list)
```
