      <description> I want to be a more considered and intentional reader, so I am going to record each book that I read. That is what a considered and intentional reader would do, right? I do not include study textbooks in this list.

      <description>“Words are to writers as clay is to sculptors.”
― (Old Jungle Saying)
 Each morning I wrestle with my computer for exactly ten minutes and crank out some sentences. I have learned that I can deliver around 500 words in this timeframe. This is seemingly the maximum output my brain and two-finger clawhammer typing technique can muster. For now.
I have been writing for many years in a sporadic fashion including publishing a few short stories and more than a few songs.</description>
