I want to be a more considered and intentional reader, so I am going to record each book that I read. That is what a considered and intentional reader would do, right?  I do not include study textbooks in this list.  







# Summary




```r
book_0 <- c("Non Fiction", "The Tao Is Silent", "Raymond M. Smullyan", "2019-11-01", "TBC", "0", "")
book_0_df <- data.frame(t(book_0), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
names(book_0_df) <- names(reading_list)

book_2_df <- data.frame(t(book_2), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
names(book_2_df) <- names(reading_list)
