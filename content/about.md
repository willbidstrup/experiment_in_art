**Experiment:** *to try something in order to discover what it is like or find out more about it.*  

**Art:** *an activity through which people express particular ideas.*  

This is my blog about living life and making things.       

I also write about [Data Science](https://www.datascienceexplorer.com/) and [Games](https://www.summonerofgames.com/).
