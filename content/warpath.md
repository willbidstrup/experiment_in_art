I am at war with the demons that lurk inside of me. 

They are crafty and patient and relentless. They change their tactics and exploit any weakness to achieve their objectives.    

Sometimes I give them names to make it easier to disassociate and gather my strength against them. Sometimes I lament their existence and turn their qualities into aspects of my art. Pain, frustration, regret, fear; these can all be used to counterpoint and accentuate joy, forgiveness and peace.  

My Warpath is simple and it has two ingredients; 

**1) Daily exercise** 

**2) Daily writing**    

From these two pillars all else follows.
